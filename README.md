## Challenge Instructions
Web Visualization Dashboard of weather in 500+ cities at different latitudes relative to the equator line.
* In building this dashboard, individual pages are created for each plot, which contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations, together with a means by which the navigation is available between different pages
* The visualizations show temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap4
* There is also a landing page showing a comparison of all of the plots, and another page displaying the data used to build them

## Website Content
1. A [landing page](https://github.com/Jiuhe2020/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/master/images/Landing_Page.png) containing:
- An explanation of the project
- Links to each visualizations page: there is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image will take the user to that visualization
  - Large screen:

  - Small screen:
![Landing_Page_Small](https://github.com/Jiuhe2020/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/master/images/Landing_Page_Small.png)
2. Four [visualization pages](https://github.com/Jiuhe2020/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/master/images/Visualization_Pages.png), each with:
- A descriptive title and heading tag
- The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison
- A paragraph describing the plot and its significance
  - Large screen:

  - Small screen:
![Visualization_Pages_Small](https://github.com/Jiuhe2020/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/master/images/Visualization_Pages_Small.png)
3. A ["Comparisons" page](https://github.com/Jiuhe2020/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/master/images/Comparisons_Page.png) that:
- Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them
- Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations: two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and one across on extra-small and small screens
  - Large screen:
![Comparisons_Page](https://github.com/Jiuhe2020/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/master/images/Comparisons_Page.png)
  - Small screen:
![Comparisons_Page_Small](https://github.com/Jiuhe2020/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/master/images/Comparisons_Page_Small.png)
4. A ["Data" page](https://github.com/Jiuhe2020/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/master/images/Data_Page.png) that:
- Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations: the table is a bootstrap table component and the data come from converting a Pandas Dataframe to HTML using `to_html` method
  - Large screen:
![Data_Page](https://github.com/Jiuhe2020/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/master/images/Data_Page.png)
  - Small screen:
![Data_Page_Small](https://github.com/Jiuhe2020/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/master/images/Data_Page_Small.png)
5. At the top of every page, there is a [navigation menu](https://github.com/Jiuhe2020/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/master/images/Navigation_Menu.png) that:
- Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page
- Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page
- Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page
- Is responsive (using media queries). The nav have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section
  - Large screen:
![Navigation_Menu](https://github.com/Jiuhe2020/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/master/images/Navigation_Menu.png)
  - Small screen:
